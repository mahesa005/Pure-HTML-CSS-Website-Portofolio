                    Hi, I’m Mahesa Fadhillah Andre, a comic enthusiast, anime enjoyer, and fitness lover who believes in blending creativity with technology. I enjoy exploring new ideas, working with others, and challenging myself to grow both personally and professionally. Outside of tech, you’ll often find me reading manga, watching anime, or hitting the gym to recharge my energy.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I’m currently a 3rd-year Informatics Engineering student at Institut Teknologi Bandung. Through my studies, I’ve built a strong foundation in software engineering, data science, and AI. I’ve worked on projects ranging from web development with modern frameworks to exploring data analytics and machine learning models. I’m also actively involved in campus organizations, where I’ve gained experience in teamwork, leadership, and building products with impact. My goal is to grow into a versatile engineer who can bridge the gap between software engineering and intelligent systems.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My professional interests lie in software engineering, artificial intelligence, and data science — particularly in creating user-friendly applications and exploring how AI can solve real-world problems. Beyond academics, I’m passionate about storytelling through comics, anime, and creative projects, as well as staying active with sports like tennis, golf, and calisthenics. This mix of technical and personal passions drives me to continuously learn, create, and bring value both in tech and in life.
